# To Do
* consider storing models instead of data.
	* write a method for the calibrator that will simply call the model on the data.
	* store only the models, without the data.
	* this might be problematic, as the plotting of the model depends on these x and y.
* Write a method that will use the with statement to change the names of columns on a 
	dataset to those needed by convention in the software. 



# Done
* is there any good of doing measure concentration on peptide-presence across runs?
    * not so much: relatively poor concentration properties
    * but did additional Stratified CV here
